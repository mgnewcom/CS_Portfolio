My final project phase 3 is a tic tac toe game where the players will take turns picking spaces until either one player gets 3 in a row or all squares are filled or neither 
player has claimed 3 in a row. One either a player has reached 3 in a row or the game ends in a tie, the game ends. The coordinates for each box are labled 1-3 for both the 
x and y axises. Both the X and Y axises are labled on each side of the gameboard. I have included a button which manually clears the board as well as a button which displays
the rules of the game and how to win. The rules can be acessed through both the home screen as well as the game screen. There is an error in my program for when I have tried 
to download my file on a diffrent computer reguarding the file being downloaded from the internet an not being trusted, the way I have resolved this issue is by downloading 
the zip file > right clicking on the zip file > going to show in folder >  in the folder I right click on the zipped file > then going to properties > then clicking on the 
checkbox saying unblock to resolve this issue. However, the most recent version of the project can still be run and the files can still be viewed.
